[00:07.690]You're insecure
[00:09.660]Don't know what for
[00:11.420]You're turning heads when you walk through the door
[00:15.180]Don't need make-up
[00:17.190]to cover up
[00:19.250]Being the way that you are is enough
[00:23.600]Everyone else in the room can see it
[00:27.430]Everyone else but you
[00:30.600]Baby you light up my world like nobody else
[00:34.440]The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[00:38.400]But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
[00:42.110]You don't know Oh oh
[00:44.750]You don't know you're beautiful
[00:46.760]If only you saw what I can see

[01:13.070]To prove I'm right
[01:14.180]I put it in a so-o-ong
[01:16.800]I don't know why you're being shy
[01:20.740]And turn away when I look into your eyes
[01:25.030]Everyone else in the room can see it
