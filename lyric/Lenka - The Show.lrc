[00:01.26]I'm just a little bit
[00:03.18]Caught in the middle
[00:04.84]Life is a maze
[00:07.06]And love is a riddle
[00:08.86]I don't know where to go
[00:11.56]Can't do it alone
[00:13.31]I've tried
[00:14.71]And I don't know why
[00:21.58]Slow it down
[00:23.57]Make it stop
[00:25.42]Or else my heart is going to pop
[00:29.34]'Cuz it's too much
[00:31.28]Yeah it's a lot
[00:34.14]To be something I'm not
[00:37.30]I'm a fool
[00:39.17]Out of love
[00:41.48]Cause I just can't get enough
[00:47.93]I'm just a little bit
[00:49.99]Caught in the middle

[01:05.60]Lost in the moment
[01:07.33]I'm so scared
[01:09.29]But I don't show it
[01:11.23]I can't figure it out
[01:14.22]It's bringing me down
[01:15.74]I know
[01:17.06]I've got to let it go
[01:21.61]And just enjoy the show
[01:23.92]The sun is hot
[01:25.98]In the sky
[01:27.93]Just like a giant spotlight
[01:31.82]The people follow the sign
[01:36.57]And synchronize in time
[01:39.79]It's a joke
[01:41.63]Nobody knows
