[00:08.25]I try to reach you I can't hide
[00:12.71]How strong's the feeling when we dive
[00:16.51]I crossed the ocean of my mind
[00:20.75]My wounds are healing with the salt
[00:24.30]All my senses intensified
[00:28.07]When ever you and I we dive
[00:32.57]Crossed the ocean of my mind
[00:36.31]But in the end I drown
[00:37.90]You push me down,down
[01:34.15]All they said
[01:40.94]When you called my name
[01:49.87]I felt pain
[01:57.29]When you came
